# Destiny 2 Discord Bot 
> Currently **ForgeBot**
---

As the name states, is a Discord bot built around Bungie's Destiny 2 game. It started off as a very simple bot that assigned roles to members in the [DESTINY 2 LFG](https://discord.gg/2Bxnjsv) Discord based off the amount off raid clears they had. After the initial developer no longer wanted to maintain the code for the seasonal changing game, I threw my hat in (having no prior coding experience) and insisted that I be allowed to update the bot.

A few months later the bot has expanded in functionality, thanks to a few helping hands. Currently the features are:

 - **Retreive** 
   - all current raid completions (separated by Normal, Prestige or Guided)
   - Clan information (Name, Member Count, Rank in Clan, Join Requirements)
   - Raid Report Ranks
 - **Assignable roles**
   - Based of retreiveable stats
   - Reaction based roles
   - Server roles are automatically updated on reaction role
   
  
### Current Status
The bot currently is highly configured to work in the [DESTINY 2 LFG](https://discord.gg/2Bxnjsv) and the code will show that. I plan on making this bot publically accessible and also add more features.


### Contributions
